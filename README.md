## Validated: 113/100

Thanks to the Minishell project, you could discover some of the backside of a shell, such as the one you use every day.

In particular, creating and synchronizing processes with the fork and wait functions.

The 21sh project proposes to go further by adding, among other things, inter-process communication using pipes.
